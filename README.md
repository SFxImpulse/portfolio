# David Braverman - Portfolio

## Section 1 - Welcome!

Dear future potential employer, or curious reader,

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Either you are here as an employer checkout out my cool projects, or someone curious enough to stumble onto this page. Either way, I welcome you to browse and see what I'm all about!

## Section 2 - About Me!
As you know, my name is David Braverman, and I am a blooming junior full stack web developer with a passion for front end development/UI/UX design. As you may have seen, I have a bunch of cool projects on here with different stacks and written in different languages.

I am a recent graduate of the Lighthouse Labs web development program, and have been making lots of projects here since then.

I am very capable with most javascript frameworks, especially React, as well as Ruby and Ruby on Rails. My next goal is to learn and develop using Python as well as C# and the .NET framework.
